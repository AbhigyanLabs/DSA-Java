DSA Repository ðŸš€

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) journey, including implementations of various algorithms and problem-solving techniques in Java. It serves as a personal learning resource and a 
reference for coding interviews and competitive programming.

ðŸ“Œ What's Inside?

âœ… Common Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs)

âœ… Sorting & Searching Algorithms

âœ… Dynamic Programming & Recursion

âœ… Greedy Algorithms

âœ… Backtracking & Bit Manipulation

âœ… Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)

âœ… Important Coding Interview Questions
